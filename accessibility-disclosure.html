  <h1>Accessibility Service Disclosure</h1>

  <p><strong>App name:</strong> Cache-Plosion (Total Cache Cleaner Pro)</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Microplosion Labs</p>

  <h2>Purpose of the Accessibility Service</h2>
  <p>
    The Accessibility Service is used solely to automate cache-clearing actions within the Android Settings app. 
    It helps users by navigating to each selected app’s storage page and performing the “Clear cache” action on their behalf — 
    exactly as if the user tapped the button manually. All actions are initiated by the user and limited only to cache cleaning.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Handling & Privacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The service does <strong>not</strong> read or collect screen content, text, keystrokes, passwords, messages, or any personal data.</li>
    <li>No input data, personal data, or sensitive information is captured, logged, stored, or transmitted.</li>
    <li>All automation and interactions occur entirely on the user’s device and never leave the device.</li>
    <li>The service performs no background monitoring or tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Consent & Control</h2>
  <p>
    The user must manually enable the Accessibility Service from Android’s system settings before it can operate. 
    The service runs only while the user has explicitly granted permission and may be disabled at any time in the device’s Accessibility settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Compliance & Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    This Accessibility Service complies with 
    <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Google Play’s Accessibility Policy
    </a>.
    It exists exclusively to support the core functionality of Cache-Plosion: helping users clear cached data faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    The service does <strong>not</strong> alter other device settings, perform actions outside the stated purpose, or access unrelated apps or data.
  </p>

  <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
  <p>
    To meet Google Play’s transparency requirements, a short demonstration video shows exactly how Cache-Plosion uses the Accessibility Service safely and correctly.
