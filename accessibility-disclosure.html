  <h1>Accessibility Service Disclosure</h1>

  <p><strong>App name:</strong> Cache-Plosion (Total Cache Cleaner Pro)</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Microplosion Labs</p>

  <h2>Purpose of the Accessibility Service</h2>
  <p>The Accessibility Service is used solely to automate cache-clearing actions within the Android Settings app. It assists users by navigating to each app’s storage screen and performing the “Clear cache” action on their behalf — exactly as if the user tapped the button manually.</p>

  <h2>Data Handling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No screen content, input data, or text is captured, logged, or transmitted.</li>
    <li>No personal or sensitive user data is collected, stored, or shared with any third party.</li>
    <li>All automation actions occur entirely on the user’s device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Consent</h2>
  <p>The user must manually enable the Accessibility Service from the Android system settings before it can operate. The service runs only while the user has explicitly granted permission and may be turned off at any time.</p>

  <h2>Compliance and Transparency</h2>
  <p>This service fully complies with <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play’s policy on Accessibility features</a>. It exists only to provide the core functionality of Cache-Plosion and does not alter device settings, collect user data, or perform actions outside the stated purpose.</p>

  <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
  <p>
    To comply with Google Play’s Accessibility Service policy, a short demonstration video shows exactly how Cache-Plosion uses Accessibility features transparently and safely.<br><br>
