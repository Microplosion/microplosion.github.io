  <h1>Accessibility Service Disclosure</h1>

  <p><strong>App name:</strong> Cache-Plosion (Total Cache Cleaner Pro)</p>
  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Microplosion Labs</p>

  <h2>Purpose of the Accessibility Service</h2>
  <p>
    The Accessibility Service is used <strong>only</strong> to automate cache-clearing steps inside the Android Settings app.
    The service helps users by navigating to each selected app’s storage page and performing the
    <strong>“Clear cache”</strong> action — exactly as if the user tapped the button manually.
    All actions are <strong>user-initiated</strong>, require explicit user permission, and only occur during a cleaning session
    started by the user.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Handling & Privacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Accessibility Service does <strong>not</strong> read or collect screen content, text, keystrokes, passwords, messages, browsing activity, or the contents of other apps.</li>
    <li>No input data, personal data, or sensitive information is captured, logged, stored, or transmitted.</li>
    <li>All automation actions happen <strong>entirely on the user’s device</strong> and never leave the device.</li>
    <li>The service performs <strong>no background monitoring</strong>, tracking, or analytics.</li>
    <li>The service never modifies system settings beyond tapping the "Clear cache" button.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Consent & Control</h2>
  <p>
    Cache-Plosion requires the user to manually enable the Accessibility Service inside the device’s system settings.
    The service is <strong>fully optional</strong> and can be turned off at any time in Accessibility settings.
    It operates only while the user has granted permission and only during active cleaning initiated by the user.
  </p>

  <h2>Additional Required Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Usage Access</strong> – used only to display the list of installed apps so users can choose which caches to clear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> – used solely to show the full list of installed apps for cleaning selection.
      This permission is <strong>not</strong> used for analytics, advertising, tracking, profiling, or any unrelated purpose.
      No app information is uploaded or shared.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Internet Access</strong> – used only to load ads (if applicable). No browsing activity is inspected or collected.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Compliance & Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    This Accessibility Service complies fully with
    <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Google Play’s Accessibility Policy
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It exists exclusively to support the app’s core functionality:
    <strong>helping users clear cached data safely and efficiently.</strong>
    It does <strong>not</strong> perform actions outside this stated purpose and does <strong>not</strong> access unrelated apps or data.
  </p>

  <h2>Transparency Video</h2>
  <p>
    To meet Google Play’s disclosure requirements, a demonstration video shows exactly how Cache-Plosion uses the Accessibility Service.
