  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Microplosion Labs</strong> develops privacy-focused Android apps such as 
    <em>Cache-Plosion (Total Cache Cleaner Pro)</em>. This Privacy Policy explains how our apps 
    handle data, permissions, and advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Microplosion Labs does not collect, store, or transmit personal or sensitive user data on its 
    own servers. We do not ask for names, emails, contacts, messages, photos, or any personally 
    identifiable information inside the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    All cleaning actions occur entirely on your device and under your direct control. We do not 
    maintain remote logs or server-side usage profiles. Limited device-level information may be 
    processed by third-party advertising partners as described in Section 3.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility Service</strong> – used only to automate the “Clear cache” button 
      inside app settings while performing cleaning steps that the user initiates. This service 
      does not read keystrokes, passwords, messages, screen contents, or personal data. No 
      information accessed through this service is stored or transmitted.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Usage Access</strong> – used only to help determine which apps are installed so the 
      user can choose which app caches to clean. No app usage history or activity data is 
      transmitted off the device.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> – used strictly to show the full list of installed apps 
      so users can select which app caches to clean. This permission is not used for analytics, 
      advertising, tracking, profiling, or any unrelated purpose. No package information is 
      uploaded or shared.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Internet Access</strong> – used only to load ads (when applicable) and check for 
      optional app updates. The app does not inspect your browsing activity or network traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>
    Accessibility permission is required only to automate cleaning steps you start; no personal 
    data is collected or shared by Microplosion Labs.
  </em></p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    Some versions of the app may show third-party ads (e.g., Google AdMob). Advertising partners 
    may process limited device information such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Android Advertising ID (AAID)</li>
    <li>Approximate region or country</li>
    <li>Device model, OS version, language</li>
    <li>IP address (for fraud prevention and network communication)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is used to deliver, measure, and improve ads. Microplosion Labs does not have 
    access to raw ad identifiers in a personally identifiable way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users may disable personalized ads in Android’s system settings. We do not include analytics 
    SDKs that collect personal or sensitive user data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Microplosion Labs does not sell, rent, or trade user data. We do not upload your app list, 
    cache data, or any on-device information to our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third-party advertising networks may receive basic, non-personal device information as part of 
    normal ad delivery. No personal data is shared.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any data processed by third-party services is subject to their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security Practices</h2>
  <p>
    We follow Android’s built-in permission and security model. The app cannot access your photos, 
    messages, files, or contacts. All cache-cleaning functions run locally on your device. We do 
    not store logs of your cleaning activity.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
    from children. If a child provides information, please contact us so we can remove it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, the “Effective Date” will be updated. 
    Continued app use after changes indicates acceptance.
