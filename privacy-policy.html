  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Microplosion Labs</strong> develops Android privacy and performance apps such as <em>Cache-Plosion (Total Cache Cleaner Pro)</em>. This Privacy Policy explains how our apps handle data, permissions, and advertising.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
  <p>Our apps do not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive information. We do not collect names, emails, or device identifiers. All app actions occur entirely on-device and under direct user control.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility Service</strong> – used only to automate cache cleaning steps that the user initiates. This permission allows the app to tap system buttons on the user’s behalf for faster cleaning. No screen content, keystrokes, or personal data are captured, stored, or transmitted.</li>

    <li><strong>Usage Access</strong> – used to identify installed apps and access their storage information so the user can clear cached data. No data is transferred off the device.</li>

    <li><strong>Internet Access</strong> – used solely to load ads (when applicable) or check for app updates. No browsing or network activity is monitored.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Accessibility permission is required to automate cache cleaning — no personal data is collected or shared.</em></p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>Some apps may display third-party ads (e.g., Google AdMob). These services may use your device’s advertising ID to show relevant ads. You can disable personalized ads in your Android settings.</p>
  <p>No analytics SDKs are used that collect personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share any personal or sensitive user data with any third parties. The app does not upload, transmit, or store any user information outside of the device. All cache-cleaning functions run locally on your device.</p>
  <p>Third-party advertising networks may receive non-personalized device information such as an advertising ID, which is standard for Android apps that display ads. No personal information is collected or shared.</p>

  <h2>5. Security Practices</h2>
  <p>We follow Android’s built-in permission and security model to ensure your data remains private and under your control. The app cannot access files, messages, photos, contacts, or any other personal content on your device.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
