  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Microplosion Labs</strong> develops Android privacy and performance apps such as <em>Cache-Plosion (Total Cache Cleaner Pro)</em>. This Privacy Policy explains how our apps handle data, permissions, and advertising.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
  <p>Our apps do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive information. We do not collect names, emails, device identifiers, contacts, messages, photos, or any personal data. All app actions occur entirely on-device and under direct user control.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility Service</strong> – used only to automate cache-cleaning steps that the user initiates. This permission allows the app to tap system buttons on the user’s behalf for faster cleaning. The Accessibility Service is <strong>not</strong> used to read or collect screen content, keystrokes, messages, passwords, or any personal or sensitive data. No information accessed by this service is stored or transmitted.</li>

    <li><strong>Usage Access</strong> – used only to display the list of installed apps so the user can choose which app caches to clear. No data is transferred off the device.</li>

    <li><strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> – used solely to display the apps installed on the device so users can select which caches to clean. This permission is <strong>not</strong> used for analytics, advertising, tracking, profiling, or any unrelated purpose. No app information is uploaded, shared, or transmitted.</li>

    <li><strong>Internet Access</strong> – used only to load ads (when applicable) and check for optional app updates. No browsing activity or network data is monitored or collected.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Accessibility permission is required to automate cache cleaning — no personal data is collected or shared.</em></p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>Some apps may display third-party ads (e.g., Google AdMob). These services may use non-personal identifiers such as the <strong>Android Advertising ID (AAID)</strong> to deliver relevant or non-personalized ads. You can disable personalized ads in your Android system settings.</p>
  <p>We do not use analytics SDKs that collect personal or sensitive information.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share any personal or sensitive user data with any third parties. The app does not upload, transmit, or store any user information outside of the device. All cache-cleaning functions run locally on your device.</p>
  <p>Third-party advertising networks may receive standard, non-personal device information (such as the AAID) as part of normal ad delivery. No personal information is collected or shared.</p>

  <h2>5. Security Practices</h2>
  <p>We follow Android’s built-in permission and security model to ensure your data remains private and under your control. The app cannot access files, messages, photos, contacts, or any other personal content on your device.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
