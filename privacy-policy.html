  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Microplosion Labs</strong> develops Android privacy and performance apps such as
    <em>Cache-Plosion (Total Cache Cleaner Pro)</em>. This Privacy Policy explains how our apps handle data,
    permissions, and advertising.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Microplosion Labs does not collect, store, or transmit personal or sensitive user data on its own servers.
    We do not ask you to provide your name, email address, contacts, messages, photos, or other personally
    identifiable information inside the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    All core cleaning actions occur entirely on your device and under your direct control. We do not maintain
    remote user profiles or server-side logs of your app usage. However, limited information may be processed
    by third-party advertising partners as described in Section 3 and Section 4.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility Service</strong> – used only to automate cache-cleaning steps that the user
      explicitly initiates. This permission allows the app to tap system buttons on the user’s behalf for
      faster cleaning. The Accessibility Service is <strong>not</strong> used to read or collect keystrokes,
      passwords, or the contents of messages. No information accessed by this service is stored or transmitted
      off the device.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Usage Access</strong> – used only to help determine which apps are installed and to display them
      in the app list so the user can choose which app caches to clear. No usage history or app activity is
      transmitted off the device.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> – used solely to display the full list of apps installed on the device
      so users can view them, analyze storage usage, and select which app caches to clean. This permission is
      <strong>not</strong> used for analytics, advertising, tracking, profiling, or any unrelated purpose.
      No app information obtained via this permission is uploaded, shared, or transmitted to Microplosion Labs.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Internet Access</strong> – used only to load ads (when applicable) and to check for optional app
      updates or remote configuration from trusted services such as the Google Play Store. The app does not
      inspect your browsing activity or network traffic.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Accessibility permission is required only to automate the cache-cleaning steps you start – no personal data is collected or shared by Microplosion Labs.</em></p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    Some versions of our apps may display third-party advertisements (for example, through Google AdMob).
    These advertising partners may collect certain device-level information, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Android Advertising ID (AAID)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (e.g., country or region)</li>
    <li>Device information (such as model, OS version, language, and network)</li>
    <li>IP address (for basic network communication and fraud prevention)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is processed by the advertising provider to deliver, measure, and improve ads, and to
    prevent invalid activity. Microplosion Labs does not have access to your raw Advertising ID or IP address
    in a way that personally identifies you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can disable personalized ads in your Android system settings (for example, by resetting or limiting
    ad personalization). We do not include our own analytics SDKs that collect personal or sensitive user data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Microplosion Labs does not sell, rent, or trade any personal user data. We do not upload your cache data,
    app lists, or other on-device information to our own servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third-party advertising networks (such as those provided by Google) may receive standard device-level
    information as described in Section 3 in order to serve and measure ads. Apart from these advertising
    partners, we do not share user data with third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any data handled by third-party services is processed under their own privacy policies. For more details
    about how Google may process data, please refer to Google’s official Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security Practices</h2>
  <p>
    We follow Android’s built-in permission and security model to help keep your data private and under
    your control. The app cannot access your photos, messages, contacts, or files unless such access is
    explicitly granted through Android permissions, which our cleaning app does not request.
  </p>
  <p>
    All cache-cleaning functions run locally on your device. We do not operate remote servers that store
    logs of your cleaning activity.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our apps are designed for general use and are <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong>.
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child under 13
    has provided personal information through one of our apps, please contact us using the information below
    so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our apps, our practices,
    or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page.
    Your continued use of our apps after an update means you accept the revised policy.
